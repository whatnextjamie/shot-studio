# Shot Studio - Environment Variables Template
# Copy this file to .env.local and fill in your actual API keys

# ===================================
# REQUIRED: Anthropic API (Claude)
# ===================================
# Get your API key from: https://console.anthropic.com/
# Used for: Conversational AI interface and storyboard generation
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-...

# ===================================
# REQUIRED: Runway API
# ===================================
# Get API access from: https://dev.runwayml.com/
# Create an account and generate an API key from the developer portal
# Used for: Video generation from storyboard shots
# Note: Runway provides ONE API secret (not separate key and secret)

RUNWAYML_API_SECRET=your-runway-api-secret-here

# ===================================
# OPTIONAL: Application Settings
# ===================================
# Your app's public URL (for production deployment)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Node environment
NODE_ENV=development

# ===================================
# TROUBLESHOOTING
# ===================================

# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY Issues:
# - Make sure key starts with 'sk-ant-api03-'
# - Check you haven't exceeded free tier limits
# - Verify key hasn't been revoked in console
# - Test key at: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys

# RUNWAYML_API_SECRET Issues:
# - Sign up at https://dev.runwayml.com/
# - Create an organization in the developer portal
# - Generate an API key from the API Keys tab
# - Copy the key immediately (shown only once)
# - Alternative: Build project without video generation first
# - Can add Runway integration later when you get access

# NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL:
# - During development: http://localhost:3000
# - After deployment: https://your-app.vercel.app
# - Must start with http:// or https://
# - No trailing slash

# ===================================
# SECURITY NOTES
# ===================================

# NEVER commit .env.local to version control!
# NEVER share your API keys publicly!
# NEVER use API keys directly in client-side code!

# This template (.env.example) is safe to commit
# The actual .env.local file should be in .gitignore

# ===================================
# DEPLOYMENT (Vercel)
# ===================================

# When deploying to Vercel:
# 1. Go to Project Settings > Environment Variables
# 2. Add each variable above (except NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL)
# 3. NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL will be auto-set by Vercel
# 4. Make sure to add variables to all environments (Production, Preview, Development)

# FREE TIER LIMITS (As of 2025)
# ===================================

# Anthropic Claude:
# - Free tier: $5 credit on signup
# - Sonnet 4.5: ~$3 per million input tokens
# - Should be enough for development and demo
# - Monitor usage: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/usage

# Runway:

# ===================================

# - Keep .env.local out of version control
# - Use separate API keys for development and production
# - Rotate keys if accidentally exposed
# - Monitor API usage regularly
# - Set up billing alerts if available
# - Use environment-specific keys in CI/CD
