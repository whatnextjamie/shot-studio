# ===================================
# TROUBLESHOOTING
# ===================================

# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY Issues:
# - Make sure key starts with 'sk-ant-api03-'
# - Check you haven't exceeded free tier limits
# - Verify key hasn't been revoked in console
# - Test key at: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys

# RUNWAY_API_KEY Issues:
# - Runway API is currently in limited access
# - Apply for access through their website
# - May need to be on waitlist
# - Alternative: Build project without video generation first
# - Can add Runway integration later when you get access

# NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL:
# - During development: http://localhost:3000
# - After deployment: https://your-app.vercel.app
# - Must start with http:// or https://
# - No trailing slash

# ===================================
# SECURITY NOTES
# ===================================

# NEVER commit .env.local to version control!
# NEVER share your API keys publicly!
# NEVER use API keys directly in client-side code!

# This template (.env.example) is safe to commit
# The actual .env.local file should be in .gitignore

# ===================================
# DEPLOYMENT (Vercel)
# ===================================

# When deploying to Vercel:
# 1. Go to Project Settings > Environment Variables
# 2. Add each variable above (except NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL)
# 3. NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL will be auto-set by Vercel
# 4. Make sure to add variables to all environments (Production, Preview, Development)
